# Facial Recognition App

## Project Overview
This project, developed in collaboration with Melab Elhadj, focuses on a Facial Recognition App that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for age and gender classification.

## Features
- **Accuracy:** Achieved 85% accuracy in age classification and 96% in gender classification.
- **Dataset:** Utilized the UTK Faces dataset, which includes over 20,000 faces, ensuring diverse representation of ages, ethnicities, and genders.
- **Data Processing:** Applied preprocessing techniques to standardize image formats and enhance data quality.
- **Data Augmentation:** Expanded the dataset to 200,000 images through augmentation strategies to improve model robustness and generalization.
- **Model Training:** Developed and fine-tuned custom CNN architectures, improving accuracy from 75% to 96% for age classification and from 64% to 85% for gender classification.
- **Web Application:**
